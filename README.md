Before starting using our API, make sure you have NodeJS installed on your device
If not here is a link to Node's official download (you may need to restart your device after intalling it) : 

    https://nodejs.org/en/download

When installation is done, in a terminal use this commande :
    npm install
It will install everthing you'll need to make the API work.

Have fun !
